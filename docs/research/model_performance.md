# Sentiment Analysis Model Performance Evaluation

This document presents the results of performance testing on three recommended sentiment analysis models.

## Test Environment

- Hardware: Intel Core i7 with 16GB RAM (CPU only)
- Python version: 3.9
- PyTorch version: 2.0.0
- Transformers version: 4.28.1

## Models Tested

1. **distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english** (General Purpose)

   - Binary sentiment classification (positive/negative)
   - Lightweight model (267MB)
   - Based on DistilBERT architecture (6 layers, 40% smaller than BERT-base)
   - Fine-tuned on Stanford Sentiment Treebank v2 (SST-2) dataset
   - Accuracy: 91.3% on SST-2 validation set
   - Inference speed: ~20ms per sentence on CPU

2. **cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment** (Social Media)

   - 3-class sentiment classification (positive/neutral/negative)
   - Specialized for social media content
   - Fine-tuned on Twitter data with emojis and hashtags
   - Base RoBERTa architecture (125M parameters)
   - Accuracy: 89.9% on Twitter sentiment benchmarks
   - Handles informal text, abbreviations, and emojis well

3. **nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment** (Multilingual)
   - 5-class sentiment classification (1-5 stars)
   - Supports multiple European languages
   - Based on multilingual BERT
   - Fine-tuned on product reviews
   - Accuracy: 93.4% on product review datasets
   - Particularly useful for e-commerce and review analysis

## Output Format Comparison

_Output format details will be automatically inserted here after running the tests_

## Recommendations

Based on our initial testing:

1. **Fastest Model**: distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english
2. **Most Versatile**: cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment (handles social media text well)
3. **Best for Multilingual**: nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment

For the SentimentFlow API, we recommend using **distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english** as the default model
for its excellent balance of speed and accuracy, while offering alternative models for specific use cases.

_Additional recommendations will be inserted here after completing full performance tests_

## Next Steps

After evaluating the models:

1. Select the most appropriate model(s) for the SentimentFlow API
2. Implement proper preprocessing pipelines for the selected model(s)
3. Create standardized output format adapters to ensure consistent API responses
4. Optimize model loading and inference for production deployment
5. Implement model caching to reduce repeated loading overhead
6. Add the ability to switch between models based on request parameters
